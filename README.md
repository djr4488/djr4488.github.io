# Welcome!
I suppose I could make this become some sort of "CV" or "index" into all the projects I'm most proud of.  Or maybe it could just be an about me?  Where to go with this?

## About me
I'm a father of five, I code, and I manage developers for a living.  I've helped a company achieve its goal of being the best in their industry through the software I have written and have chosen to leave that job to do the same again in a different industry.  I've worked for the government, a large corporation, a start up(which I just described) grow from 25 people to over 650 in just under 5 years, and now a not quite start up I hope to do the same for.

## Technologies I use and like(and some I don't like so much)
1. **Basis of applications I've written.**  JavaEE with TomEE for the container.  I really like this combination, it is simple and lets the developer have more control of what is required to implement a business solution. 
2. **Making things async** JMS with ActiveMQ.  While I am good with ActiveMQ, I am strongly looking forward to Artemis being released and working with TomEE.
3. **Making things convoluted** Interceptors.  They have their place, don't get me wrong, but like anything in life with power comes responsibility and if you put significant business logic in one of those it probably should be documented as such.  
4. **Don't really care for** Spring Boot.  Some people really like the Spring Framework, and good for you!  I'm not judging you, I don't really care for Spring Boot or the SpringFramework too much.  But I cannot really tell you why, maybe it is because I'm just used to having a little more control instead of so much abstraction that it sometimes has been difficult to differentiate between a coding bug and a configuration problem.
5. **Data** ElasticSearch and MySQL. Yup, I have used both of these, and both serve a purpose.  Use them inappropriately, and both will bite you hard.  Use them correctly(like anything else again), and things will simply just work.  Though I do prefer PostgreSQL over MySQL, just found it in some cases a little easier.
