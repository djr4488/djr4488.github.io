# Welcome!
I suppose I could make this become some sort of "CV" or "index" into all the projects I'm most proud of.  Or maybe it could just be an about me?  Where to go with this?

## About me
I'm a father of five, and I code and manage developers for a living.  I've helped to build a company achieve its goal of being the best in their industry through the software I have written, and have chosen to leave that job to do the same again in a different industry.  I've worked for the government, a large corporation, a start up(which I just described), and now a not quite start up.

## Technologies I use and like(and some I don't like so much)
1. **Basis of applications I've written.**  JavaEE with TomEE for the container.  I really like this combination, it is simple and lets the developer have more control of what is required to implement a business solution. 
2. **Making things async** JMS with ActiveMQ.  While I am good with ActiveMQ, I am strongly looking forward to Artemis being released and working with TomEE.
3. **Making things convoluted** Interceptors.  They have their place, don't get me wrong, but like anything in life with power comes responsibility and if you put significant business logic in one of those it probably should be documented as such.  
4. **Don't really care for** Spring Boot.  Some people really like the Spring Framework, and good for you!  I'm not judging you, I don't really care for Spring Boot or the SpringFramework too much.  But I cannot really tell you why, maybe it is because I'm just used to having a little more control instead of so much abstraction that you it sometimes has been difficult to differentiate between a coding bug and a configuration problem.
5. **Data** ElasticSearch and MySQL. Yup, I have used both of these, and both serve a purpose.  Use them inappropriately, and both will bite you hard.  Use them correctly(like anything else again), and things will simply just work.  Though I do prefer PostgreSQL over MySQL, just found it in some cases a little easier.

## Things I'd like to share with the world
1. Anything you see on my github.
2. In particular, I like the work I've done on my CDI project and the Retrofit project(to make a Feign like client for Java EE).  
3. Things I have out there, which I'm not as proud of, my cards game, and my metrics library.  I leave them there because I hope to either finish them and correct the issues I perceive in them, or use them as a reminder of, what the heck was I thinking when I did that?!?!

## Fun fact
1. I like thunderstorms, and if given the opportunity will chance a tornado with my Brother-in-law.
